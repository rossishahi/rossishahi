- 👋 Hi, I’m @rossishahi
- 👀 I’m interested in IT. Have been interested for so long but never got through to it in terms of actually committing to it for professional growth. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python from scratch...AGAIN (It has always been an on-&-off kind of thing for a couple of years now). This time though, I am going to stick for the long haul. Watch out for me, guys!
- 💞️ Connect with me @rossishahi (also my Discord username) for collaborative learning.
